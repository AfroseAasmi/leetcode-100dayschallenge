There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:

++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
--X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.
Initially, the value of X is 0.

class Solution(object):
    def finalValueAfterOperations(self, operations):
        """
        :type operations: List[str]
        :rtype: int
        """
        x=0
        for i in operations:
            if '-' in i:
                x=x-1
            elif '+' in i:
                x=x+1
        return x
