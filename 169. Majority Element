Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

 lass Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n=len(nums)
        nums=sorted(nums)
        return nums[n//2]
